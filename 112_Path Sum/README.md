# Question: (Easy)

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

For example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

>   		5       <br>
>		   / \      <br>
>		  4   8     <br>
>        /   / \    <br>
>       11  13  4   <br>
>      /  \      \  <br>
>     7    2      1  <br>

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
