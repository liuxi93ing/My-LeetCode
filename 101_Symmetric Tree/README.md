# Question: (Easy)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

>   		1       <br>
>		   / \      <br>
>		  2   2     <br>
>        / \ / \    <br>
>       3  4 4  3

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

>   		1       <br>
>		   / \      <br>
>		  2   2     <br>
>          \   \    <br>
>           3   3

## Note:

Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively
