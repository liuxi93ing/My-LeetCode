# Question: (Easy)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example:

>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
>return [0, 1].

# 笔记：

indices 是 index 的复数

vector 实体可理解为容量可变数组

``` C++
vector<int> v; 	//创建vector 对象v
v.size(); 		//返回当前长度
v.push_back(a); //在末尾添加数据 a
```
