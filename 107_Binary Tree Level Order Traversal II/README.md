# Question: (Easy)

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

>       3      
>      / \     
>     9  20  
>        / \	 
>       15  7	 

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

>[			<br>
>  [15,7],  <br>
>  [9,20],  <br>
>  [3]      <br>
>]
